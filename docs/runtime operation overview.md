## Evaluator Handler Runtime Operations

Handlers are core components responsible for evaluating and processing messages within the Eliza framework. They operate through a multi-stage execution process that ensures proper validation and sequential processing.

### Evaluation Process
The evaluation process is managed by the `evaluate()` method in the `AgentRuntime` class, which coordinates the validation and execution of handlers based on the current message and state.

### Execution Stages
1. **Parallel Validation**: All evaluators are validated concurrently
2. **Resolution and Filtering**: Valid evaluators are filtered and selected
3. **Text Generation**: Context-aware selection of evaluators to run
4. **Sequential Handler Execution**: Selected handlers are executed in sequence

### Runtime Flow
- Handlers are executed in a deterministic sequence
- Each handler receives runtime context, message, state, and callback
- Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascading failures
- Performance metrics are collected during execution

## Provider Runtime Operations

Providers serve as dynamic context injectors that bridge the agent with external systems and real-time information sources.

### Provider Lifecycle
1. **Registration**: Providers are registered through plugins
2. **Runtime Integration**: Providers are integrated into the runtime environment
3. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple providers can run concurrently
4. **Context Generation**: Each provider contributes to the overall context

### Provider Types
1. **State Providers**: Manage and update operation state
2. **Data Providers**: Fetch and format external data
3. **Context Providers**: Generate contextual information

### Provider Runtime Architecture
- Providers operate in parallel
- Results are aggregated and filtered
- State updates are handled sequentially
- Resource management is optimized

## Action Runtime Operations

Actions are the primary mechanisms through which agents effect change in their environment, enabling interaction with external systems and control of conversation flow.

### Action Architecture
Actions follow a clear flow:
1. Message received by Runtime
2. Language Model generates response
3. Action Handler processes the action
4. Services are interacted with
5. Results are returned to user

### Action Lifecycle
1. **Registration**: Actions are registered through plugins
2. **Validation**: Prerequisites and permissions are checked
3. **Execution**: Action handler processes the request
4. **State Management**: Actions can modify and maintain state

### Built-in Actions
1. **Conversation Flow Actions**
   - CONTINUE: Manages follow-up responses
   - IGNORE: Handles conversation disengagement

2. **Integration Actions**
   - TAKE_ORDER: Example of external system integration
   - Custom actions can be added through plugins

## Common Patterns Across Components

1. **State Management**
   - Consistent state access across components
   - Sequential state updates
   - State preservation between calls

2. **Error Handling**
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Graceful degradation
   - Error logging and monitoring

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel execution where possible
   - Resource management
   - Caching strategies

4. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin-based architecture
   - Custom component registration
   - Flexible integration points
